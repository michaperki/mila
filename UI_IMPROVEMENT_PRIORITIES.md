## 🔹 Overall UX Strengths

* **Clarity of purpose:** “Scan → Read → Save vocab” loop is intuitive.
* **Consistent component styling:** Cards, buttons, and headers have good visual hierarchy.
* **Navigation bar** feels predictable and lightweight.
* **OCR integration flow** is well-structured with readable feedback.

## 🔸 Key Improvement Areas (Priority-Ordered)

### **1️⃣ Highlight the Active Tab in Navbar (HIGH PRIORITY)**

Currently, the bottom nav bar icons (“Camera,” “Current,” “Vocab,” “Settings”) don’t show which tab is active.
**Fix:**
Add an active-state indicator:

* Use a **filled icon**, a **primary color underline**, or a **subtle glow** around the current tab.
* Example:

  ```css
  .nav-item.active { color: var(--primary); font-weight: 600; }
  .nav-item.active svg { fill: var(--primary); }
  ```

This improves user orientation immediately—especially important for mobile UX.

### **2️⃣ Improve “Recent Texts” Card Readability**

The layout is good, but it’s slightly text-heavy.

**Suggestions:**

* Increase whitespace between OCR title and text sample.
* Add a subtle divider or border accent.
* Show only the **first 1–2 lines** of the OCR preview with a “View All” button.

---

### **3️⃣ Sentence Navigation UI (Medium Priority)**

The “Next” and “Previous” buttons in the “OCR Text” screen are easy to miss visually.

**Improvements:**

* Add arrow icons (◀ ▶) and increase button contrast.
* Show “Sentence X of Y” more prominently—e.g., in bold or in the card header.
* Consider enabling keyboard arrows for navigation.

---

### **4️⃣ Vocabulary List (Medium Priority)**

The vocab page works well, but could use **grouping and search polish**.

**Suggestions:**

* Add date grouping headers (e.g., “Added Today,” “Earlier this week”).
* Show source text snippet (context) under each word for better recall.
* Add “Starred” or “Mastered” toggle badges.

---

### **5️⃣ Settings Page (Lower Priority but Easy Win)**

Excellent structure, but minor polish helps UX.

**Ideas:**

* Add dividers or cards around “Display / Language / Audio / OCR / Storage” sections for better scanning.
* Persist toggle states visually (switch instead of checkbox).
* Show estimated storage size dynamically (e.g., “2.3 MB — 0.5% of limit”).

---

## 🧩 Bonus / Future Suggestions

* **Persistent App Header:** Show “ReadLearn” at top of all tabs for brand continuity.
* **Dark Mode Tweaks:** Some color contrast may need tuning (e.g., gray text on dark backgrounds).
* **Loading States:** Add spinner or “Processing text…” when OCR runs.
* **Vocab Gamification:** Add quick quiz/review mode (“Tap to recall meaning”).
